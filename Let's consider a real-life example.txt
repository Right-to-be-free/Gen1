Let's consider a real-life example related to customer purchases at a store and incorporate all the statistical concepts you've mentioned.

Scenario: A Small Coffee Shop Analyzing Customer Behavior
A small coffee shop wants to analyze its daily sales and customer behavior using probability and statistics.

1. Probability Mass Function (PMF)
The PMF describes the probability of a discrete random variable taking specific values. Suppose the number of coffees a customer buys follows this PMF:

P(X = x) = \begin{cases} 0.4, & x = 1 \text{ (40% buy 1 coffee)}\\ 0.3, & x = 2 \text{ (30% buy 2 coffees)}\\ 0.2, & x = 3 \text{ (20% buy 3 coffees)}\\ 0.1, & x = 4 \text{ (10% buy 4 coffees)} \end{cases}
This PMF gives the probability of customers buying 1, 2, 3, or 4 coffees.

2. Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
The CDF gives the probability that a customer buys at most a certain number of coffees:

𝐹
(
𝑋
)
=
𝑃
(
𝑋
≤
𝑥
)
F(X)=P(X≤x)
For our example:

𝑃
(
𝑋
≤
1
)
=
0.4
P(X≤1)=0.4 (40% buy at most 1 coffee)
𝑃
(
𝑋
≤
2
)
=
0.4
+
0.3
=
0.7
P(X≤2)=0.4+0.3=0.7 (70% buy at most 2 coffees)
𝑃
(
𝑋
≤
3
)
=
0.7
+
0.2
=
0.9
P(X≤3)=0.7+0.2=0.9 (90% buy at most 3 coffees)
𝑃
(
𝑋
≤
4
)
=
1
P(X≤4)=1 (100% buy at most 4 coffees)
The CDF shows how probabilities accumulate.

3. Probability Density Function (PDF)
Since PDF applies to continuous data (e.g., height, weight, or time), we can use it for the time customers spend in the shop.

If the time a customer stays follows a normal distribution, the PDF is given by:

𝑓
(
𝑥
)
=
1
𝜎
2
𝜋
𝑒
−
(
𝑥
−
𝜇
)
2
2
𝜎
2
f(x)= 
σ 
2π
​
 
1
​
 e 
− 
2σ 
2
 
(x−μ) 
2
 
​
 
 
where:

𝜇
=
30
μ=30 minutes (average time spent),
𝜎
=
5
σ=5 minutes (standard deviation).
The PDF describes the likelihood of a customer staying a specific number of minutes.

4. Bernoulli's Distribution
Each customer either buys a pastry (success = 1) or does not (failure = 0). This follows a Bernoulli distribution with probability 
𝑝
p.

If 60% of customers buy a pastry:

𝑃
(
𝑋
=
1
)
=
0.6
,
𝑃
(
𝑋
=
0
)
=
0.4
P(X=1)=0.6,P(X=0)=0.4
Each customer’s choice is an independent Bernoulli trial.

5. Binomial Distribution
Now, let’s say the coffee shop gets 10 customers per hour, and we want to find the probability that exactly 7 customers buy a pastry.

Since each customer follows a Bernoulli process, the total number of customers buying a pastry follows a Binomial distribution:

𝑃
(
𝑋
=
𝑘
)
=
(
𝑛
𝑘
)
𝑝
𝑘
(
1
−
𝑝
)
𝑛
−
𝑘
P(X=k)=( 
k
n
​
 )p 
k
 (1−p) 
n−k
 
where:

𝑛
=
10
n=10 (total customers),
𝑘
=
7
k=7 (customers buying pastries),
𝑝
=
0.6
p=0.6 (probability of buying a pastry).
𝑃
(
𝑋
=
7
)
=
(
10
7
)
(
0.6
)
7
(
0.4
)
3
P(X=7)=( 
7
10
​
 )(0.6) 
7
 (0.4) 
3
 
This tells us how likely it is that 7 out of 10 customers buy pastries.

6. Normal Distribution
The daily revenue follows a normal distribution with an average 
𝜇
=
500
μ=500 dollars and a standard deviation 
𝜎
=
50
σ=50 dollars.

𝑋
∼
𝑁
(
500
,
50
2
)
X∼N(500,50 
2
 )
Using this, we can estimate:

The probability of making more than $550 in a day.
The probability of making between $450 and $550.
A Z-score transformation helps calculate these probabilities.

7. Linear Equation
The shop notices that the revenue 
𝑅
R depends on the number of customers 
𝐶
C as:

𝑅
=
5
𝐶
+
50
R=5C+50
where:

Each customer spends an average of $5.
The shop has a fixed daily income of $50 from pre-orders.
This is a linear equation predicting revenue based on customer count.

8. Correlation
The shop analyzes two variables:

Temperature (°F)
Number of iced coffee sales
It finds a strong positive correlation (
𝑟
=
0.8
r=0.8), meaning as temperature increases, iced coffee sales also increase.
